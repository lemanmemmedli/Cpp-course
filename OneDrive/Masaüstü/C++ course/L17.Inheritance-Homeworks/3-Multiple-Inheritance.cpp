/*
    What You Will Learn:

    By completing this exercise, you will not only have enhanced your understanding of constructor design 
    and access specifiers but also gained insights into the principles of encapsulation and object-oriented design. 
    You will be better equipped to create classes with well-designed constructors 
    and appropriately chosen access specifiers for improved code organization and maintainability.
*/


/*
    Exercise Description:

    In this exercise, you will work on enhancing the provided C++ program 
    that models a basic object-oriented project and task management system. 
    The focus will be on constructing classes with optimal constructor design 
    and understanding the selection of access specifiers (public, protected, private) to achieve encapsulation. 
    Your task is to both complete the exercise objectives and respond to questions about constructor design and access specifiers.

/* Starter Code: */

class Project {
    // ... (Same as provided code)
    protected:
    string projectName;

    public:
    Project() : projectName("Unnamed Project") {};

    Project(string projectparam)
    :projectName(projectparam){};

};

class TeamMember {
    // ... (Same as provided code)
    public:
    string teamName;

    TeamMember() : teamName("Unnamed teamName"){};
    TeamMember(string teamparam)
    :teamName(teamparam){};
};

class Task {
    // ... (Same as provided code)
    protected:
    string taskName;

    public:
    Task() : taskName("Unnamed taskName"){};
    Task(string taskparam)
    :taskName(taskparam){};

};

class ProjectTeamMember : public Project, public TeamMember {
    public:
    ProjectTeamMember(string projectparam,string teamparam)
    :Project(projectparam),TeamMember(teamparam){};

    void displayProjectTeamMember(){
        cout<<"Project: "<<projectName<<endl;
        cout<<"Team Member: "<<teamName<<endl;

    }
};

class TeamMemberTask : public TeamMember, public Task {
    public:
    TeamMemberTask(string teamparam,string taskparam)
    :TeamMember(teamparam),Task(taskparam){};

    void displayTeamMemberTask(){
        cout<<"Task Name: "<<taskName<<endl;
        cout<<"Team Member: "<<teamName<<endl;
    }
};


/*
    Exercise Tasks:

    1. Class Constructor Design:
    Review the constructor design of the existing classes (Project, TeamMember, Task). 
    Analyze how constructors are used to initialize class attributes. 
    Identify any areas for improvement in terms of constructor parameters and member initialization. 
    Refactor the constructors as needed to ensure optimal and meaningful initialization of class attributes.

    2. Access Specifier Analysis:
    Study the classes and their member attributes (projectName, memberName, taskName). 
    For each attribute, decide whether it should be declared as public, 
    protected, or private based on the principle of encapsulation. 
    Explain your decision-making process for each attribute and its access specifier choice.

    3. Constructors and Inheritance:
    Explore how constructors are inherited in C++ classes.
    Given the inheritance relationships between classes (ProjectTeamMember, TeamMemberTask),
    discuss how constructors from base classes are called during the creation of derived class instances. 
    What considerations should be made when working with constructors in an inheritance hierarchy?

    4. Constructor Overloading:
    Introduce constructor overloading in one of the classes (e.g., Project). 
    Provide multiple constructors with different parameter sets. 
    Explain the scenarios in which each constructor might be useful and how they contribute to the flexibility of object creation.

    5. Access Specifiers and Inheritance:
    Consider the access specifiers used in the ProjectTeamMember and TeamMemberTask classes. 
    Explain the impact of these access specifiers on the visibility of inherited members within the derived classes. 
    Provide examples of scenarios where the choice of access specifiers affects class behavior.

    /*
        Discussion Questions:

        1. How does constructor chaining contribute to the efficient initialization of class attributes in an inheritance hierarchy?
        2. When designing constructors, what factors should you consider to ensure meaningful and concise parameter lists?
        3. Explain the benefits of using access specifiers (public, protected, private) to control the visibility of class members. 
        Provide examples of scenarios where each access specifier is suitable.
        4. How can constructor overloading improve the usability of a class and simplify object creation for different use cases?
        5. In the context of inheritance, how does the choice of access specifiers for inherited members influence the interaction between base and derived classes?

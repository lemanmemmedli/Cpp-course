    /*
        Why order of constructor destructor calls in C++ follows in this manner?

        Answer: 
        By following this order of constructor and destructor calls, 
        C++ ensures that objects and their components are initialized and cleaned up in a predictable and orderly manner, 
        considering the dependencies and relationships within the class hierarchy. 
        This helps prevent issues such as using uninitialized objects or accessing destroyed resources.

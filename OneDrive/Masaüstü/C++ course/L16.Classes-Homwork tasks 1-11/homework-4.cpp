/*
    Exercise: Employee Management System

    You are tasked with creating an employee management system for a company.
    Each employee has a name, age, position, and salary.
    Your goal is to implement a class called Employee that encapsulates
    these attributes and provides appropriate setters and getters.

    Your task is to create a C++ class called Employee with the following specifications:

    1. Private member variables:
        name (string): Holds the name of the employee.
        age (int): Holds the age of the employee.
        position (string): Holds the position/title of the employee.
        salary (double): Holds the salary of the employee.

    2. Public member functions:
        setName(const string& name): Sets the name of the employee.
        setAge(int age): Sets the age of the employee.
        setPosition(const string& position): Sets the position of the employee.
        setSalary(double salary): Sets the salary of the employee.
        getName() const: Returns the name of the employee.
        getAge() const: Returns the age of the employee.
        getPosition() const: Returns the position of the employee.
        getSalary() const: Returns the salary of the employee.

    Your implementation should allow external code to set and get the attributes of
    an Employee object using the appropriate setter and getter functions.

    Here's a code template to get you started:
*/

class Employee
{
private:
    string name;
    int age;
    string position;
    double salary;

public:
    void setName(const string &name)
    {
        this->name = name;
    }
    void setAge(int age){
        this->age=age;
    }
    void setPosition(const string& position){
        this->position=position;
    }
    void setSalary(double salary){
        this->salary=salary;
    }

    string getName() const{
        return name;
    }
    int getAge() const{
        return age;
    }
    string getPosition() const{
        return position;
    }
    double getSalary() const{
        return salary;
    }

};

int main()
{
    Employee employee;

    employee.setName("Jane");
    employee.setAge(20);
    employee.setPosition("manager");
    employee.setSalary(3000.0);

    cout<<employee.getName()<<endl;
    cout<<employee.getAge()<<endl;
    cout<<employee.getPosition()<<endl;
    cout<<employee.getSalary()<<endl;


    return 0;
}

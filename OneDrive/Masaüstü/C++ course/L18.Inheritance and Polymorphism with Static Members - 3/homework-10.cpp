    Exercise: Implement static methods within the Circle and Rectangle classes 
    to calculate the areas of circles and rectangles, respectively. 
    Additionally, create a static method in the Shape class to compare the areas of two shapes.

    Tasks:

    1. Implement the CalculateArea static methods in the Circle and Rectangle classes to calculate the areas of circles and rectangles, respectively.
    2. Create a static method in the Shape class to compare the areas of two shapes. You'll need to access the CalculateArea static methods in the derived classes for this comparison.
    3. In the main function, prompt the user to enter the radius for a circle and the width and height for a rectangle.
    4. Calculate and display the areas of the circle and rectangle using the static methods.

    Implement comparisons of areas using the static method in the Shape class to determine if the areas are equal.

/*
    Exercise: Create a library management program with C++ that models different types of items 
    (books and DVDs) and their late fee calculations. 
    Implement the missing parts of the code and complete the tasks below.

    Tasks:

    1. Implement the missing parts of the code, including the calculateLateFee method for both the Book and DVD classes.
    2. Initialize and update the totalItems static member in the LibraryItem class when a new item is created.
    3. In the main function, create instances of both Book and DVD, display their information, and calculate late fees for them.
    4. Finally, display the total number of library items using the totalItems static member.

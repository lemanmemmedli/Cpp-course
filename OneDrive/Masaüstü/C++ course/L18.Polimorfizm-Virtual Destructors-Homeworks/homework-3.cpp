*/


/*
    Scenario:

    You are developing a C++ program to simulate a car race. 
    The program will have a base class called Vehicle and two derived classes, Car and Motorcycle. 
    The Vehicle class will have methods to get and set the vehicle's speed, direction, and position. 
    The Car and Motorcycle classes will inherit these methods from the Vehicle class and may also have their own unique methods.

    Exercise:

    Decide which of the following methods should be polymorphic in the Vehicle class:
       - getSpeed()
       - setSpeed()
       - getDirection()
       - setDirection()
       - getPosition()
       - move()
*/

/*
    Solution:
        - move() 
*/



/*
    Exercise_2: Polymorphic Methods in E-Commerce

    Scenario:

    You are developing an e-commerce platform. 
    The platform will have a base class called Product and several derived classes, such as Book, Electronic, and Clothing. 
    The Product class will have methods to get and set the product's name, price, and description. 
    The derived classes will inherit these methods from the Product class and may also have their own unique methods.

    Exercise:

    Decide which of the following methods should be polymorphic in the Product class:
       - getName()
       - setName()
       - calculateTax()
       - calculateShipping()
       - getPrice()
       - setPrice()
       - getDescription()
       - setDescription()
*/

/*
    Solution:

       - calculateTax()
       - calculateShipping()
        
*/



/*
    Exercise_3: Polymorphic Methods in Backend Development

    Scenario:

    You are developing a backend for a social media platform. 
    The backend will have a base class called User and several derived classes, 
    such as RegularUser, ContentCreator, and Administrator. 
    The User class will have methods to get and set the user's name, email address, and profile picture. 
    The derived classes will inherit these methods from the User class and may also have their own unique methods.

    Exercise:

    Decide which of the following methods should be polymorphic in the User class:
       - getName()
       - manageUsers()
       - setName()
       - postContent()
       - getEmailAddress()
       - setEmailAddress()
       - getProfilePicture()
       - deleteContent()
       - setProfilePicture()
*/

/*
    Solution:
    - manageUsers()
    - postContent()
    - deleteContent()

/*
    Exercise: Decide on Virtual Methods

    You are provided with a payment processing system implemented in C++. 
    The system includes a base class Payment and three derived classes: CreditCardPayment, 
    DebitCardPayment, and PayPalPayment. Each payment method has its own unique behavior.

    Your task is to decide which methods should be polymorphic (i.e., override in derived classes) 
    and modify the code accordingly. 
    
    Follow these steps:

    1. Review the existing code and identify methods that should be made virtual (polymorphic). 
    Polymorphic methods are those that have a different implementation in the derived classes 
    and are related to the specific payment method.
    2. Implement virtual methods in the derived classes by overriding the base class method.
    3. Update the main function to create instances of different payment methods, set payment details, 
    and process payments using polymorphism.
    4. Test the code to ensure that each payment method behaves correctly and that polymorphism is used effectively.

    Note: You can make any method virtual if it is related to the specific payment method's behavior. 
    Some methods may not need to be virtual if they have a common implementation across all payment methods.

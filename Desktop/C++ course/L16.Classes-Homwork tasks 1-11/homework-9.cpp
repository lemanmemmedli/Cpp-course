using namespace std;

/*
    Exercise:
    Implement a class called MathOperations that performs basic mathematical operations. 
    The class should support chaining calls using pointers. 
    The following operations should be supported:

    1. add(int val): Adds the given value to the current result.
    2. subtract(int val): Subtracts the given value from the current result.
    3. multiply(int val): Multiplies the current result by the given value.
    4. divide(int val): Divides the current result by the given value.
    
    Additionally, the class should provide a getResult() function that returns the current result.

    In the main() function, create an instance of MathOperations and demonstrate 
    the use of chained calls by performing the following operations:

    1. Start with an initial result of 10.
    2. Add 5, subtract 2, multiply by 3, and divide by 4.
    3. Print the final result.

    Note: Ensure that the class handles division by zero gracefully and returns an appropriate message.
*/


/* Solution */




int main() {

    /*      Example usage:     */
    MathOperations math(10);
    
    math.add(5)->subtract(2)->multiply(3)->divide(4);
    
    cout << "Final result: " << math.getResult() << endl;
    
    return 0;

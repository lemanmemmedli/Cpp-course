    Exercise: Online Shop System

    Description:
    Design and implement an Online Shop System using multiple files and classes in C++. 
    The system should allow you to manage products and orders in an online shop.

    Requirements:

    1. Create two classes: "Product" and "Order".

    2. The "Product" class should have the following attributes:
        Product ID (an integer)
        Product name (a string)
        Product price (a floating-point number)

    3. The "Order" class should have the following attributes:
        Order ID (an integer)
        Customer name (a string)
        Ordered products (an array/vector of Product objects)
        (Vectors: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/vector-in-cpp-stl/)
    
    4. Define the "Product" class in a separate header file called "Product.h" 
    and implement its member functions.

    5. Define the "Order" class in a separate header file called "Order.h" 
    and implement its member functions

    6. Include the necessary header files in the main program file.

    7. Demonstrate the functionality of the Online Shop System by creating products, 
    creating orders, and performing operations like adding products to orders, calculating order totals, etc.

    Tips:

    Use header files to declare the class structure and member function prototypes.
    Use include guards or pragma once to prevent multiple inclusion of header files.
    
    This exercise will help you practice creating separate classes in different files 
    and including them in a main program file to build a functional Online Shop System!

int main() {

    system("clear");

    // Create products
    Product p1(1, "Product 1", 10.0);
    Product p2(2, "Product 2", 20.0);
    Product p3(3, "Product 3", 30.0);

    // Create an order
    Order order(1, "John Doe");

    // Add products to the order
    order.addProduct(p1);
    order.addProduct(p2);
    order.addProduct(p3);

    // Calculate the order total
    double total = order.calculateOrderTotal();

    // Display the order details
    cout << "Order ID: " << order.getOrderID() << endl;
    cout << "Customer Name: " << order.getCustomerName() << endl;
    cout << "Ordered Products:" << endl;

    for (const Product& product : order.getOrderedProducts()) {
        cout << " - " << product.getProductName() << endl;
    }
    
    cout << "Total: $" << total << endl;

    return 0;
